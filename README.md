## Overview

Notebit redefines the note-taking experience by placing AI at its core. It's not just about storing notes; it's about actively engaging with your knowledge through intelligent chat, powerful organization tools, and personalized AI assistance. Whether you're researching complex topics, drafting content, or simply organizing your thoughts, Notebit provides a smart, secure, and always-accessible environment. With its offline-first architecture powered by local PouchDB storage, your data remains private and available anytime, anywhere.

#### üîç **AI Memory & Semantic Search**

- **Configurable Embedding Models:** Choose from various embedding models (e.g., `nomic-embed-text`, Ollama-served models) to power semantic understanding.
- **Deep Search:** Find information based on meaning and context, not just keywords, across your notes and Smart Hubs.

#### üé® **Comprehensive Customization & Settings**

- **Appearance:** Light, Dark, & System themes; customizable accent colors, font styles, and font sizes.
- **AI Model Management:** Enable/disable providers, configure connection settings (e.g., Ollama API host), refresh model lists, and add custom models.
- **Data Management:** Define notes storage location and manage AI Memory (embedding model) settings.
- **General Settings:** Control link behavior, automatic chat title generation, and more.

#### üåê **Cross-Platform & Offline-First**

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

A brief overview of the main directories:

- `src/main`: Electron main process code (Node.js environment). Handles window management, system interactions, and tRPC backend.
- `src/preload.ts`: Secure bridge script between the main and renderer processes, exposing necessary APIs via `contextBridge`.
- `src/shared`: Code, types, and utilities shared between the main and renderer processes (e.g., tRPC router definitions).
- `src/web`: Renderer process code (React application running in the browser-like environment).
  - `app/`: Core application setup, providers, global state.
  - `components/`: Reusable UI components (often built with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS).
  - `features/`: Self-contained modules for major application features (e.g., Notes, Chats, Settings, SmartHubs).
  - `routes/`: Routing configuration using TanStack React Router.
  - `shared/`: Web-specific shared utilities, hooks, and contexts.
- `src/assets/`: Static assets like icons and images.
