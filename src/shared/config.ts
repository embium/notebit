/**
 * TanStack Query Client configuration
 *
 * This client manages all data fetching, caching, and synchronization for the application.
 * It's used by both React Query hooks and tRPC React hooks internally.
 *
 * Configuration notes:
 * - networkMode: "always" ensures queries/mutations don't depend on online/offline browser status
 *   which is appropriate for Electron where "network" is actually IPC to the main process
 * - cacheTime: Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY keeps query results in memory indefinitely
 *   which is optimal for Electron desktop apps because:
 *   1. Memory constraints are less restrictive than in web browsers
 *   2. Data is local and relatively small (notes, settings, etc.)
 *   3. The app lifetime is limited to the user's session
 *   4. It prevents unnecessary refetching of data from the main process
